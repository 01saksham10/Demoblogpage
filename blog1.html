    <p class="description">The first step was learning HTML, which helped me understand the structure of a webpage. I learned how headings, paragraphs, images, and links work together to form a website. After that, I moved on to CSS, which allowed me to design and style my pages by adding colors, spacing, and layouts.
<br>
One important lesson I learned was to practice by building small projects. Simple projects like a personal portfolio, a blog page, or a landing page helped me understand concepts better than just watching tutorials.
<br>
Another challenge was feeling overwhelmed by the number of technologies available. Instead of trying to learn everything at once, I focused on mastering the basics. Once the foundation was strong, learning new tools became easier.
<br>
In conclusion, learning web development as a beginner is not about speed—it’s about consistency and practice. Anyone can learn web development with the right mindset and dedication</p>
