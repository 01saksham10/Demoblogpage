<p>Another mistake was skipping proper practice. Watching tutorials felt productive, but without building projects, the concepts didn’t stay clear. I also relied too much on copy-pasting code without understanding how it worked, which made debugging difficult later.
<br>
I also underestimated the importance of consistency. Studying irregularly made it harder to remember what I had learned. Over time, I realized that learning a little every day was more effective than studying a lot once in a while.

In the end, these mistakes helped me learn better strategies. By focusing on fundamentals, practicing regularly, and learning step by step, my web development journey became more structured and enjoyable.</p>
