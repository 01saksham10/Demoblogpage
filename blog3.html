<p>One of the most helpful resources was freeCodeCamp. It provided structured lessons and hands-on coding challenges, which helped me understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript step by step. The projects at the end of each section also boosted my confidence.

Another useful resource was W3Schools. Whenever I was confused about a tag or CSS property, I used it as a quick reference. Its simple examples made learning faster and less frustrating.
<br>
YouTube tutorials also played an important role. Watching experienced developers build projects helped me understand how real websites are created. However, I learned that watching alone was not enough, so I always practiced what I learned.

In conclusion, using the right learning resources saved time and made my web development journey smoother. With consistency and practice, these resources helped me build a strong foundation.</p>
