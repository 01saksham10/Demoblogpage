    <p class="description">One of the most helpful resources was freeCodeCamp. It provided structured lessons and hands-on coding challenges, which helped me understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript step by step. The projects at the end of each section also boosted my confidence.
<br>
Another useful resource was W3Schools. Whenever I was confused about a tag or CSS property, I used it as a quick reference. Its simple examples made learning faster and less frustrating.
<br>
YouTube tutorials also played an important role. Watching experienced developers build projects helped me understand how real websites are created. However, I learned that watching alone was not enough, so I always practiced what I learned.
<br>
In conclusion, using the right learning resources saved time and made my web development journey smoother. With consistency and practice, these resources helped me build a strong foundation.</p>
